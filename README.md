Your hub for picturesque nihilism.

## But …

No.

## Setup

I used Nuxt because ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯. (Actually, because Nuxt is amazing.)

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the [Nuxt.js docs](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js).

## Maintenance

Even though I honestly ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ that this is the most important site in the world (or something) I may ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ at maintaining it. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯.

If I don’t ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ at developing this site you can find beta features in the `koenntesein` branch. Könnte sein is German for maybe. It’s like a Beta but just maybe.

### Maybe To Do List

- Add a service worker. Because real ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ don’t need no network
- Think about design
- Think about thinking

## Colophon

Made with ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
